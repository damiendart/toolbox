Damien's Toolbox
================

My dotfiles, random scripts, and other things of varying quality.

  - My dotfiles are pretty unremarkable. Running `install` will create
    symlinks into your home directory.
  - _derp_: Highlights minor formatting issues in text files.
  - _dummytext_: A simple dummy text generator.
  - _gitstreak_: Calculates the current Git commit streak.
  - _pinboardbackup_: A simple Pinboard backup script.
