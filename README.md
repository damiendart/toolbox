toolbox
=======

My dotfiles and random scripts of varying quality.

To get set up:

1.  Use Git to download a copy of the *toolbox* repository, ensuring
    that any [Git submodules][] (currently used to manage third-party
    Vim plugins) are also initialised and updated.
2.  Run the `install` script located in the repository root to create
    the relevant symlinks in your home directory.
