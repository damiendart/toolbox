Usage: $(basename "$0") [FLAGS] [INITIAL-QUERY]

Launches Vim with the fuzzy grep/ripgrep doohickey already active. By
default, the ":FG" Vim command will be used, which respects any ignore
files (e.g. ".gitignore").

Requires whatever "$HOME/.vim/plugin/fuzzy-grep.vim" requires and that
the EDITOR environment variable is set to some sort of Vim.

FLAGS:

  -e, --everything
    Use the ":FGA" Vim command, which searches through everything.

  -h, --help
    Display this help text and exit.
